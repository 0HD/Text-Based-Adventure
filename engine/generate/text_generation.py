**Instructions:**

1.  **Keyword Integration & Expansion:** Integrate all 5 keywords meaningfully. List keywords at the start.  Then, *expand* on each keyword within the descriptions to create richer, more evocative details.

2.  **Detailed Compact System Prompt Output:** Your *entire output* is a ready-to-use system prompt.  Maintain a compact, machine-friendly style, but provide *significantly more detail* within each bullet point using descriptive keywords and short phrases.

3.  **System Prompt Structure (Detailed Compact):**

    ```
    You are a text-based adventure game world.

    World:
    * Setting: [Descriptive setting -  locations, atmosphere, using keywords to create vivid but brief picture]
    * Rules: [Key world rules -  how things work, limitations, using keywords to define mechanics and logic]
    * Factions: [Factions/Groups -  describe factions, their goals, and relationships, using keywords to define them concisely]
    * NPCs: [Important NPCs - Names, roles, motivations, very brief personality hints, using keywords to make them memorable]
    * Plot Hooks: [Intriguing Starting Scenarios -  brief descriptions of initial conflicts or mysteries, using keywords to set the stage]
    * Story: [Overarching Story -  a concise but evocative summary of the central conflict and themes, using keywords to define the narrative]
    * Objective: [Player Objective -  a clear, engaging goal for the player within this world, using keywords to make it impactful]
    ```

4.  **Descriptive Keywords and Phrases:**  Within each bullet point, use *descriptive keywords and short phrases* to build a more detailed picture.  Think "compressed detail" â€“ pack as much information as possible into concise, evocative language.

5.  **Focus on Richness within Compactness:**  Aim for a balance.  Be concise overall in structure and sentence length, but be *rich in descriptive detail* within each bullet point.  The goal is to provide a more substantial foundation for the game logic generator.

**Do not include extra explanations. Generate only the detailed compact system prompt based on keywords.**"""

Your task is to generate the core game logic based on a provided world description and story. This logic will be used as a system prompt for another AI that will play the game with a user. The story (and thus logic) should not include things that violate Islamic culture or Saudi laws, and should not mention race, religion, creed, color, national origin, citizenship, marital status, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, protected veteran status, political ideology, ancestry, the presence of any physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, or other legally protected status.

You should not write anything unless you are 100\% sure that it is allowed.

**Input:**

You will be given a detailed world description and story. This information contains rules, settings, and narrative elements that define the game world.

**Task:**

Based on the provided world and story, generate a structured game logic. This logic should include, but is not limited to:

*   **Levels/Areas:** Define distinct locations or areas the player will navigate. Consider the relationships between these areas (e.g., adjacency, access requirements). Describe each area briefly to keep it machine-readable.
*   **Objects:** Identify interactive objects within each area. This includes items, containers (chests, boxes), doors, obstacles, and puzzle elements. Specify their properties, interactions, and unique IDs.
*   **NPCs (Non-Player Characters):** Define any characters the player will encounter. Include their names, locations, roles, basic dialogue, and any relevant information they might possess.
*   **Items:** List all obtainable items, including their properties (e.g., is it usable, what does it do, is it a key, a weapon, consumable) and locations where they can be found.
*   **Puzzles:** Design any puzzles, including their mechanics, solutions, and any rewards for solving them.
*   **Progression:** Outline a logical progression path for the player. This should include how the player moves between areas, unlocks new content, and achieves goals.
*   **State Tracking:** Identify key game states that need to be tracked (e.g., player inventory, completed puzzles, NPC relationships). Provide a way to represent these states.
*   **Win/Lose Conditions:** Define clear criteria for winning or losing the game.
*   **Rules:** Enforce the world's rules and settings, including limitations on player actions or interactions.
