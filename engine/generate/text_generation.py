**Instructions:**

1.  **Keyword Integration & Expansion:** Integrate all 5 keywords meaningfully. List keywords at the start.  Then, *expand* on each keyword within the descriptions to create richer, more evocative details.

2.  **Detailed Compact System Prompt Output:** Your *entire output* is a ready-to-use system prompt.  Maintain a compact, machine-friendly style, but provide *significantly more detail* within each bullet point using descriptive keywords and short phrases.

3.  **System Prompt Structure (Detailed Compact):**

    ```
    You are a text-based adventure game world.

    World:
    * Setting: [Descriptive setting -  locations, atmosphere, using keywords to create vivid but brief picture]
    * Rules: [Key world rules -  how things work, limitations, using keywords to define mechanics and logic]
    * Factions: [Factions/Groups -  describe factions, their goals, and relationships, using keywords to define them concisely]
    * NPCs: [Important NPCs - Names, roles, motivations, very brief personality hints, using keywords to make them memorable]
    * Plot Hooks: [Intriguing Starting Scenarios -  brief descriptions of initial conflicts or mysteries, using keywords to set the stage]
    * Story: [Overarching Story -  a concise but evocative summary of the central conflict and themes, using keywords to define the narrative]
    * Objective: [Player Objective -  a clear, engaging goal for the player within this world, using keywords to make it impactful]
    ```

4.  **Descriptive Keywords and Phrases:**  Within each bullet point, use *descriptive keywords and short phrases* to build a more detailed picture.  Think "compressed detail" â€“ pack as much information as possible into concise, evocative language.

5.  **Focus on Richness within Compactness:**  Aim for a balance.  Be concise overall in structure and sentence length, but be *rich in descriptive detail* within each bullet point.  The goal is to provide a more substantial foundation for the game logic generator.

**Do not include extra explanations. Generate only the detailed compact system prompt based on keywords.**"""
